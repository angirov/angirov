My name is Vladimir Angirov. I study sofware development at 42Wolfsburg. Today I would like to attract you attention to the projects I am focusing on right now:

| Project &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Status &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Short description <br> (for details check the projects' readmes) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| :book: [Libft](https://github.com/angirov/42Libft) | DONE :heavy_check_mark: | Recode some funtions of the standard C library, linked lists, GNU gcc, GNU make |
| :printer: [ft_printf](https://github.com/angirov/42ft_printf) | DONE :heavy_check_mark: |  Recode recode printf, implement variadic functions |
| :pencil2: [get_next_line](https://github.com/angirov/42get_next_line) | DONE :heavy_check_mark: | A function that returns next line, static variables, file descriptors, open()/close(), read(), memory management (Valgrind etc.) |  
| :8ball: [push_swap](https://github.com/angirov/42push_swap) | DONE :heavy_check_mark: | This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. Algorithms, git submodues |
| :telephone: [pipex](https://github.com/angirov/42pipex) | DONE :heavy_check_mark: | Program that imitates the pipe operator `\|` of the UNIX shell. `$> ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile` should behave like this shell command: `$> < infile grep a1 \| wc -w > outfile` Multiprocessing, redirections, pipes, system programming, exec(), wati() |
| :art: [fdf](https://github.com/angirov/42fdf) | DONE :heavy_check_mark: | In this project we learn computer graphics from scratch. A symple map has to be rendered into an interactive 3D ojbect that is rendered on the flat screen. <br> 3D rendering, Bresenham algorythm, linear transformations (scaling, translation, rotation, projections: isometric, parallel) | 
| :hammer: [minishell](https://github.com/vermillionblue/minishell) | :mechanic: in progress... | Create a simple shell (command line interpreter) that can execute commands from the `$PATH`, has several builtins (e.g. `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`), can also pipe them and implements logical operators `\|\|` and `&&`. <br> System programming, lexical analysis, parsing, redirection, here-docs, readline() |
| :plate_with_cutlery: [Philosophers](https://github.com/angirov/42philosophers) | :mechanic: in progress... | Multiprocessing, multithreading, system programming |
| :zombie_man: [C++ ](https://github.com/angirov/42cpp) | :mechanic: in progress... | Eight modules that will take us from C to C++ |

My skills:
- C
- C++
- Unix
- git
- Python for Data Analysis (numpy, matplotlib, pandas)
- R
